The Souvenir Case will enable you to examine, edit, or eradicate any of the emblems of your erstwhile expeditions!

Simply log in with a username and password to get started.  You'll quickly find yourself on a page displaying all of the souvenirs which have been added to the database.  You can view their names, their sources, and brief descriptions of the items.  Ready to add your own?  Let's head over to "My Souvenirs"!

Here, enter the necessary informatin into the indicated fields: name, source, year obtained, and description.  Press save, and voila!  You may now gaze upon your treasures, and others will be in awe of your worldliness.  Wait, what's this?  A typo in one of your entries?  Or you misremembered the date again?  No problem!  We'll just click on the souvenir's name, and a form will load allowing us to edit any of the fields.

What now?  You're overburdened with all of the priceless relics and artifacts of your journeys?  Embracing minimalism?  No worries!  Just hit the "Delete" button, and we'll, uh, take care of the rest...

Once you've had your fill of nostalgia, simply hit "Log Out" from any page in the site, and you're back on the road again!

Building this app required the synthesis of all the major programming concepts addressed thus far.  It was a lot of fun to code outside the boundaries of an Rspec test, and it is quite exhilarating to see your ideas take form.  I look forward to following the natural progression with Rails.
