Looking back to when I began this project, I realize that I initially underestimated the challenge of getting my idea to work in a way that made any kind of sense.  I went through several iterations of  changing database schemas and model associations before I could make it work in a way that seems to make sense and also seems to meet the project requirements.  It was very much like the classic portrayal of writer's block, with the writer crumpling up page after page and tossing it behind themselves.

However, once I had my database sorted, the magic of Rails allowed everything to come together fairly quickly.  Rails makes things easy in a lot of ways, sometimes it feels almost too easy.  You can really feel the MINSWAN coming through as Rails works hard to make things simple, easy, and even enjoyable.  That said, this was certainly the most challenging project so far, at least for me.  I had more difficulties with Omniauth and other aspects of the project, and made frequent visits to the Rails docs as well as previous labs.

As with everything along this journey, working with Rails has been both frustrating and rewarding.  Completing this project has improved my confidence in my ability to problem solve and work up solutions.  However, it has also made me more aware of the challenges that programmers face, such as the issues that arise with passwords.
