In terms of implementation, this seemed to be the most straight-forward of the projects I've encountered so far.

This was partly due to the fact that I was simply updating my previous Rails app to use JavaScript, rather than starting a new app from the ground up.  But it's also partly due to that incredible Rails magic that takes care of so much for you.  Indeed, the Rails magic is so powerful that certain spells are forbidden for this project (remote: true).  No matter, Active Model Serializers are still there to do the real heavy lifting.

There were of course many snags, frustrations, and stressful moments.  Many of the lessons had to be re-visited, and Google was frequently consulted.  But even when I couldn't rely on Rails to simplify things, jQuery was often able to step in and help me out, and there is a ton of documentation out there for using it in different scenarios.

The end result is an app that is much more mature, in the sense that it has far greater capabilities to interact dynamically with users and data.  Although it still has a long way to go, it's easy to see how the addition of JavaScript opens up a lot of possibilities for the future development of this app.
