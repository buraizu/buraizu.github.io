Working through my final project has been overwhelming at times, and has required an adjustment in my standard approach to these projects.   Unlike previous units, some of the requirements for this project go beyond the course material.  I wasn't able to go back over lessons for answers to some of the challenges I faced, and this forced me to be more creative and resourceful.  Ultimately, I'm really glad for this, as the project feels more authentically 'mine'.

As I worked through the project, I was cognizant of the fact that this would be the project to showcase to future employers.  In all past projects, I felt a pressure to get through them and onto the next section.  But the section after this is the job search, and I want to be as well prepared as possible.  

Therefore, I took my time with this one, often spending a full day or multiple days working on a single feature or aspect of the program.  This was very frustrating, and at times I was tempted to scrap certain parts in order to proceed.  In these situations, stepping away and taking a break is crucial.  I sometimes find that I can reason better about my code when I'm not actually looking at it, and that when I return  to the computer with a more relaxed and refreshed perspective, the solution pops right out.

The final result is Emerald City Runs, an app which retrieves data from the Activity API of Active.com.  It filters the results for running events in the Seattle area, and this data is then saved in a Rails db.  The front end of the app is handled by React/Redux, which allows users to select an event to train for.  Users are also able to log their training runs as they prepare for the event, with all CRUD actions available to them.
