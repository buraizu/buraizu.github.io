Rails, to me, was like walking into a giant subway station in a new city for the very first time.  Initially, it's overwhelming, and seeminly chaotic and confusing.  The entries and exits, the ticket machines, the layout, everything is bewildering and takes time to navigate.  

After a few visits, you start to get the feel for it.  You have a sense of the layout, the different tracks, where the trains go, and you start to appreciate the convenience that Rails provides.  As your understanding grows, you can begin to zip about anywhere with ease.  Want to get to point X, Y, or Z?  You know automatically which platform to go to and what ticket you'll need when you get there.

Initially, I was definitely that tourist at the station, wandering around in bewilderment.  Now, I can get around most of the popular places pretty easily.  If there's somewhere I don't know how to get to, it doesn't take very long to figure it out.  With very few lines of code, Rails gives you an amazing amount of convenience.
