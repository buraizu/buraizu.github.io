My reasons for taking up this endeavor are not unique and not particularly interesting.  

However, what has interested me is the sensation of liberty and accomplishment that come from crafting something new.  As aptitude gradually increases, the constraints upon imagination gradually decrease.

Like many others, I lament not pursuing these abilities sooner in my life and career.  It is easy to dwell upon that regret, but it was mentioned in a video that the best may still be to come from the web.  Adopting this perspective helps to shift the focus of my mind, and I find myself compelled to strive for greater aptitude and understanding.  There is still opportunity, all the cool inventions haven't been invented yet.

Many of the things that brought me here seem mundane and miserable.  But the things which propel me forward are increasingly enticing to the imagination.
